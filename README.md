# 🐚 Bash Scripting Playground

A collection of **practical Bash scripts** for learning, automation, and system-level tasks on Linux.  
This repository focuses on **hands-on examples** commonly used in real-world development, DevOps, and system administration.

The scripts are inspired by and built while learning from **Bobby Iliev’s _Introduction to Bash Scripting_**, with additional enhancements and experimentation.
